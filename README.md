# Hiking Trails App


## Project Description

As someone who enjoys hiking, I have noticed that there are very few apps that provide detailed information about hiking trails, such as their distance, difficulty level, and terrain. That's why I decided to create a hiking trail web app that can cater to hikers all around the world.
With this app, you'll have access to a plethora of hiking trails from all around the world, complete with detailed information about each one. You'll also be able to read reviews from other hikers to get a better idea of what to expect. Additionally, we've included a feature that allows hikers to add new trails to the app that may not already be listed.


## Getting Started

In order to fully utilize our hiking trail web app, we kindly ask that you create an account and log in. This will grant you access to all the detailed information about each hiking trail, as well as the ability to add new trails to the app. Additionally, if you happen to come across any inaccuracies or outdated information, you'll be able to make changes to the trail's listing. All we require is a valid email address for your account.
